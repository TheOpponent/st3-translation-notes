Notes for the translation of the Dreamcast game _Sakura Taisen 3 - Paris wa Moeteiru ka_ (サクラ大戦3 〜巴里は燃えているか〜). Data formats used by the game are documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheOpponent/st3-translation-notes/wiki).

The code in the Scripts directory is in the public domain, with the exception of the lib subdirectory. Python scripts require Python 3.7 or newer. Some scripts require [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/), [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org), and [pythonnet](https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet) as dependencies. 

Scripts that make use of PRS compression currently use the [prs.net](https://github.com/FraGag/prs.net) library.

Files in the External subdirectory are retained from external sources and kept for the sake of preservation and reference.
