Notes for the translation of the Dreamcast game _Sakura Taisen 3 - Paris wa Moeteiru ka_ (サクラ大戦3 〜巴里は燃えているか〜). Data formats used by the game are documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheOpponent/st3-translation-notes/wiki).

The code in the Scripts directory is in the public domain, with the exception of the lib subdirectory. Python scripts require Python 3.9 or newer. Some scripts require [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) and/or [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org). 

Scripts that make use of PRS compression use [PRSTools by ToriningenGames](https://github.com/ToriningenGames/PRSTools), adapted into a library.

Files in the External subdirectory are retained from external sources and kept for the sake of preservation and reference.

# Instructions
Clone this repository, and install [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/) and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org). To use the GUI tools, install [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org) as well. The GUI tools are a work in progress.

Follow the instructions in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheOpponent/st3-translation-notes/wiki) for getting started with the translation process.
