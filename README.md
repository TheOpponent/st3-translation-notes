Notes for the translation of the Dreamcast game _Sakura Taisen 3_. Data formats used by the game are documented in the [wiki](https://github.com/TheOpponent/st3-translation-notes/wiki).

The code in the Scripts subdirectory is in the public domain, with the exception of the lib subdirectory. Python scripts require Python 3.7 or newer. 

The SBX compression and decompression scripts use the [prs.net](https://github.com/FraGag/prs.net) library, and using them currently requires building prs.net, copying FraGag.Compression.Prs.dll to Scripts/lib/, and installing [pythonnet](https://github.com/pythonnet/pythonnet).

Files in the External subdirectory are retained from external sources and kept for the sake of preservation and reference.
