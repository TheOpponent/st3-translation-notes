# Uses the prs.net implementation of PRS compression:
# https://github.com/FraGag/prs.net/blob/master/FraGag.Compression.Prs/Prs.Impl.cs
#
# This script decompresses SBX files, which are PRS-compressed files with extra wrapping added.
# Uncompressed files are written into the 'source' subdirectory with extension .SBX.bin.
# Existing files will be overwritten.
